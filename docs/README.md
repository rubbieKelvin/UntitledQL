# UntitledQL

Don`t be swayed by the name, this isn't a query language of any sort. UntitledQL is a rest implementation with stolen features from graphql. While this doesnt resemble graphql by any means, UQL grants you the ability to;

- call all your api services from one endpoint
- query your models from client without explicit implementation from your side. CRUD functions are provided out of the box
- select specific fields from api response
- subscribe to events without the use of web sockets [would require client implementation : `in-development`]
- easily setup permissions for model operations
